# worktical

 this is a script inspired by hollywood.
https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood
I wrote this to be a bit more simplified 
and more specifically can be used in a closed
environment using native tools or tools
that are installed as core OS utilities


execute the script and any sleep commands inside default to .3
execute the script with a float/integer after and that is the sleep timer:
ie... ./worktical .01

Tested on OSX, RHEL and Ubuntu
